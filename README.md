# Repositories:
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets

# Branching:
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
*To create a new branch
  Go to your new repository hello-world.
  Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master.
  Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
  Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.
# Commits:
Saved changes are called commits. 
Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 
*Make and commit changes
  Click the README.md file.
  Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
  In the editor, make the changes (also write a commit message that describes your changes).
  Click Commit changes button.
  
# Pull Requests
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams.

Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original)
Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.
When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.
